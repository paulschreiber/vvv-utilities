# Build a bash array to pass all of the packages we want to install to a single
# apt-get command. This avoids doing all the leg work each time a package is
# set to install. It also allows us to easily comment out or add single
# packages. We set the array as empty to begin with so that we can append
# individual packages to it as required.
